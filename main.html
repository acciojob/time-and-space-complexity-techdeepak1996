	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>
    Time complexity is a measure that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm has a time complexity that grows slowly with the size of the input. This ensures that as the input size increases, the increase in time taken by the algorithm remains manageable.

<p>
    Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a computational problem as a function of the input size. When analyzing algorithms, we often use notation like <b>O(n)</b> to express the upper bound of the space an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. Understanding the space complexity of an algorithm is crucial, especially when working with limited memory resources.
